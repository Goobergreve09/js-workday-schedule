## Description
  In this challenge I was given starter code of an workday schedule to edit. The schedule is setup according to a 9 AM to 5 PM workday schedule routine. When each hour passes, that column will be greyed out, when it os of the current hour, that hour will show in red, and when all hours are yet to come, those hours will appear in green. The styling of this challenge was done with bootstrap. When the user types in a description of the scheduled event and hit the save button at the end of each column the text content of the user description is saved into local storage and then kept there upon closing of the browser or a refreshing of the tab. There is also a date in the header of the page which changes based on the current day using day.
